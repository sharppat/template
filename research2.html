			<h1>Background into Engineering</h1>
			<p>From every corner of the earth, humanity has always been searching for ways to transcend its boundaries.  Since man has been roaming the earth nearly 200,000 years ago, engineers have been search for ways to do just that. With the first major breakthrough with the invention of the wheel and fire, engineering has been exploding into society left and right. It is everywhere and everything. Professor Timothy J. Hinds of Michigan State University notes, “Take a moment and look around you, everything you see that did not grow out of the ground was designed, created, and put into production by an engineer. The desk you sit at, the chair you sit on, the cloths you wear, are all forms of technology that were produced do to the field of engineering.”</p>
<p>All aspects of engineering are magnificent in the fact that they all come to be in order to surmount a problem, answer a question, or headway the advancement of humanity. Much like the creation of the wheel where the problem existed in how to move large objects without massive work forces or disassembly and reassembly, there exists new challenges today. The questions of the past where however, much broader and easier to accomplish do to the lack of information during pre-enlightenment eras and the lack of technological understanding. Today the questions become much more complex to answer. Each sub field or discipline of engineering tries to narrow out and accomplish one of the engineering feats known as the “Grand Challenges”,</p>	<p>1.	Make solar energy economical</p><p>2.	Provide energy from fusion</p><p>3.	Develop carbon sequestration methods</p><p>4.	Manage the nitrogen cycle</p><p>5.	Provide access to clean water</p><p>6.	Restore and improve urban infrastructure</p><p>7.	Advance health informatics</p><p>8.	Engineer better medicines</p><p>9.	Reverse engineer the brain</p><p>10.	Prevent nuclear terror</p><p>11.	Secure cyber space</p><p>12.	Enhance virtual reality</p><p>13.	Advance personalized learning</p><p>14.	Engineer the tools of scientific discovery</p><p>Each one of the grand challenges, defined by the National Academy of Engineering, is a representation of one of the problems we face today. Engineers in every field seek to answer those questions with the most effective solution. Although the importance lies on how to answer these questions, communication is much more important. With a lack of communication throughout a field of study, engineers would never be able to learn anything other than what they already know. You may believe differently but communication is not just face to face or a phone call, communication is the spread of information or influence in any media. Books, websites, talking, research, etc, are all forms of communication. Without these we would never have made it past the first grade much less on our way to Mars. </p>	</article>
