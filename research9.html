			<h1>Wrapping It All Up</h1>
			<p>Communication is the foundation of accomplishment among the field of engineering. Affective communication within the field creates a wide base of knowledge for others to work on, speeds up the progressiveness of projects, and prevents engineers of the future from digressing to the same mistakes that we have already made. It is vital to keep detailed notes of your work as well as reporting your findings or inventions to other engineers. Another important aspect is to never take for granted one form of communication over the others. This bias attraction leads to a lack of skill in the other two areas and in some cases near loss of simple implementation. With an over usage of cyber space in the twenty first century, many people have lost effective communication skills in simple one on one conversation and in turn have lost the ability to work effectively in the field of engineering. For example, if you lose the ability to affectively talk to a person face to face, how will you ever make a good impression at an interview for a job? Similarly if you become attached to the internet and slang terms, how will you ever be able to write an application worthy of a job? If you plan to become an engineer, make sure to remain fluent in every form of communication no matter how silly it seems. In the long run, Communication is everything within the field of engineering!</p>
