			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Now that you have heard simply a few of the unnumbered amount of degrading effects of pornography on society, how do we escape the fate of a world ruled by four ministries and dominated with sexual acceptance? With each passing day, the line between sexually explicit and socially acceptable grows thinner. Shows like South Park are making it seem okay for kids to be exposed to sexually explicit material. The world is quickly endorsing material that would have been considered repulsive and unacceptable to society during the late 1900’s, and the likely hood of it stopping on its own is nonexistent. Unfortunately there is no permanent solution to the issue. If pornography becomes banned from the internet and illegal to produce than it will simply slip back into the underground and continue to expand like it did in its origins during the early 1900’s. Similarly, the effects of pornography on society have already been absorbed and would be nearly impossible to undo. </p>
	<p>However, attempts can be made to bottle neck the flow of pornography through society and regulate the exposure in public displays. Various companies and pornographic sites already follow regulations that ask the user to submit some kind of ID token in order to confirm that they are of age able to view the site. This solution nonetheless, is not enough. Not every site requires this kind of access nor do some sites even check for age verification, so what is the solution? The real solution remains a joined force between regulating pornographic sites and life at home. Regulations can be made and carried out by government agencies to enforce strict age verification to pornographic sites and removal from the internet without them. Stage two remains in part to the business world and the FCC. The FCC needs to improve upon and crack down on the regulations of public promotion ads and Television material. They can make sure that provocative television commercials are kept to certain limits and that certain material never even makes it on air. Similarly to the commercials, certain shows like South Park, Family Guy, and American dad need to be regulated as well. This solution can easily help slow the spread of pornography and decrease the amount of exposure to adolescence viewers. </p><p>The third step in this joint effort is to not only regulate the internet but regulate your children as well. At home, children should not have private access to computers/internet via in-room laptops, etc. having private access to the internet allows children to wonder the web freely without concern of “over the shoulder views”. Passwords on home computers also help regulate the usage of the internet and demand physical observation when the computer is in use. Television should also be monitored. For viewers of age, shows like South Park are perfectly okay, but for younger ages, they can be detrimental. Although these are only solutions that can help diverge under aged children from viewing pornography, it is simply the first few steps into rewriting the way we view sexual relations. In recent studies carried out in the UK by “The Big Four”, they began to enforce regulations over pornographic sites and enforcing severe age restrictions. The research showed that over the course of only a few years, as the viewing of pornography decreased, the number of sexual crimes decreased as well. (Don’t Just Regulate the Net-Regulate You’re Kids, 1). Long term effects have yet to be determined since the study has only been in effect for a few years but prospects look promising.</p>	</article>
