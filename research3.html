			<h1>Communication Through Speach</h1>
			<p> Each form of communication is unique and important to the advancement of the engineering field in its own way. The simplest and respectively the oldest form of communication is word of mouth. Predating the mass production of books via the printing press, the best form of communication was by word of mouth. Engineers and scientist spread ideas by physically meeting with each other and discussing their ideas. In early England and during the enlightenment period scholars of all forms would meet in parties known as think tanks and discuss their new discoveries. Although today we can overcome the need for these kind of gatherings with the use of books and the internet, the capabilities of physical communication are still extremely important. Think about how different the company would be if Steve Jobs couldn’t stand in front of the audience and unveil the IPhone. Although it may be the oldest and sometimes seem irrelevant in today’s society, Conversational and presentational communication is still a prevalent part of being an engineer. </p>
