			<h1>A Second Glance From Dr. Silvis</h1>
			<p>The second account is given from a man who has been working and studying in the field of engineering since his graduation from Colorado University in 1984. Dr. Mathew Silvis is currently an executive project director for Cisco and formerly a project manager at Delphi Automotive. Dr. Silvis recalls that before the invention or public use of the internet, “information was like a rare commodity to come by and you had to search for it in a library or archive. Today my grandson can hop on Google and read about my patents 30 years ago”. Dr. Silvis continues by explaining that effective writing is the most important form of communication among the field of engineering. He tells of how good writing skills can transfer into any form of communication, “If you can write in a proper manor, than you can certainly talk in a proper manor”. Although Dr. Silvis stands with his love for books and research he also gives light to the fact that the internet has sparked interest in younger minds and has further progressed the field of engineering in vastly a good way. In terms of writing style he concludes that styles such as MLA are widely used in professional atmospheres and that they should be used and engrained in the writing habits of anyone who seeks to become a successful engineer.</p>
