		<h1>The Final Project</h1>
		<p>
If you ever find yourself enrolled as a freshman at Michigan State University, than buckle yourself in because you’re in for a writing experience like you’ve never seen before. Over the course of my freshman year I have completed four major literary works that have helped me define my writing style for the rest of my life. Each paper outlined and focused on a specific format of technical writing that is used primarily in the business world. The first of the list of projects was the Lived experience project which required each writer to reflect back into their childhood and choose one toy or experience that defined who they were today. This specific project focused on the writing style “Narrative”. The second project was the Cultural analysis project where each student chose a specific piece of pop culture and explained its effect on society as well as a solution to that problem. This project focused on the writing style “Formal Proposal”. The third project and probably the most important project was the formal research paper. This project required each student to do extensive research into the field of study in which they are pursuing and write a technical analysis of their findings. Each paper was specific into which style they were focused on and were great learning tools for future papers.
</p>		<p>The first project of the year fell under a unique category of purposes. Each student was to evaluate every toy they had owned throughout the course of their childhood and choose one. This one toy was not to be just any toy though, it was to be the specific toy that bottlenecked all of their interest and lead them to choose the field of study in which they want to pursue. My specific paper focused on my childhood favorite toy of LEGOs. My paper detailed the specific events in my childhood where LEGOs gave me the medium to express the ideas in my head and feed the hunger inside my imagination. LEGOs were a key building block in my life that broke the ice on my love for engineering.  At this point in the semester my writing style was undeveloped and still unfortunately in high school mode. This piece helped break ground on the perspective of personal narrative and began to break down the finer points of formal writing styles. While still holding the aspects of a sum what formal paper, our teacher taught us of what it meant to really grab a paper and make it your own. This was important seeing as how it is a personal narrative. We learned how to captivate our reader and how to turn the emotions that we felt into writing.</p>
		<p>Shortly following the lived experiences project came the cultural analysis. Within the parameters of this paper we were to analyze a piece of pop culture and state the negative effects it has had on society and state a brief solution. This project Helped to strengthen the weak base that existed in my ability to write a professional grade analysis paper. It began to form my technical writing skills as well as convey key points of an overall good writing style. The thoughts within the paper were more complete and relevant than so seemed in previous papers of mine. As well as good technical writing came an overall better understanding of formal structure as a whole. My specific paper outlined the troubles behind South Park and its crude yet humorous out take on serious situations. The topic of Pornography is squeamish within society and we mostly choose to turn the other way when it is mentioned. With this in mind I took an alternative stance through South Park and evaluated it and its negative effects in a less direct way. In retrospect I could have spent more time analyzing South Park as a whole and not the specific episode I picked but within a paper that has limited space, certain things begin to take priority and that is simply one aspect of technical writing.</p>
		<p>The third project and by far the most important is the formal research project. This project brought together all the aspects of each project we’ve done thus far and put it into one large research paper. Each aspect of the writing class had lead up to this point and now was the opportunity to showcase the skills developed over the course of the class. My paper covered the field of engineering and what it takes to become an engineer. This project required each student to analyze a plethora of both analytical papers as well as informal papers from newspapers and magazines that pertained to the field they were researching. With each paper, the revision search became a more defined search. Key words from each paper helped me to narrow down my search from the entire field of engineering to Aviation Mechanics. I do admit that I could have spent a much more generous amount of time reading research papers and engineering findings in order to get a better grasp on the topic than I have now. The hardest part of this paper was not researching nor writing this paper but yet creating the medium in which it was to be presented. At this point in the class we needed to be able to create our own website using html format. At this, I had not succeeded. It was a struggle to create the page and I ended up taking short cuts that I would not take now. Overall this project was a big help to me in the aspect that it got me off of my lazy bum and got me really thinking about the field that I plan on studying and participating in for the rest of my life. To that, I owe this project some gratitude for motivating me to dissect the finer aspects of engineering and decipher the intricate field that supports it.</p>
		<p>The final aspect of the class was an online section. For this portion of the class we were to obtain the skills necessary to design, create, and post our own website. In order to do this we had to learn HTML and CSS, the two main and most basic programs of website creation. In relevance to actually learning the code we used an online program called Codecademy. Codecademy is an online resource that helps students and teachers learn the basics all the way up to professional grade web design skills. Through a series of lessons on Codecademy I began to form my own website in which to post all of the papers I had written. As the course went on my skills became more proficient and creating webpages became a cinch with the help of Github. Now that the semester is winding down to an end, I can create my own website in the matter of an hour or two. Accompanied with my own website, each class has to come together and create a final webpage that will host all of the papers of each student throughout the year. The project is broken down into sections according to paper and a final group that will specifically focus on web design. I am a part of the web design group. Overall I have come to thoroughly enjoy Codecademy as it is extremely user friendly. Unlike most sites, Codecademy does not believe in busy work and aimless repetition. This makes it easy to follow and fast to learn. I would recommend Codecademy to anyone looking to go into web design or simply learn HTML. I will probably continue to use Codecademy as I advance in the field of engineering to create bigger and better projects as well switch to the more advanced courses where you can learn Ruby, Python, CSS, and a few other programs. </p>
		<p>In hind sight this class has done well to teach me all about formal research and technical writing. I have taken away a surplus of information that I did not know prior to as well as got the chance to refine my writing skills as a whole. Each project gained ground in developing my own personal writing style while still working towards the higher goal of creating a technical style for me to use in my career. Probably the most help of all came from one of the course literacies The Curious Researcher. This book contained all of the knowledge anyone could ever hope to attain about writing in the field of engineering as well as throughout the business field all together. I learned more from this book than any of the class sessions I went to. Similar to the course text was codecademy where I learned everything I ever needed to know about creating a website in html as well as the beginning points of CSS, none of which I understood when taught in class. I have learned a plethora of things both about writing and my own personal writing style from this class and would recommend this class to anyone who would like to learn about online publishing and technical writing styles.</p>
		<p>The best advice I can give anyone taking this class is to not procrastinate on the projects because they will catch up with you and you will be up all night figuring out how to make the website work! Not that I’ve been in that situation or anything…
