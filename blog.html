			<h1>blog number 1: welcome to confusion...</h1>
				<p>So, this is my blog for my writing class. Thus far if I've learned anything at all it would be that HTML is quite confusing and even when it is all set up for me to use and layed out to the fact that all I have to do is type in the blank space...I still feel lost. that being said, I am excited to learn HTML and unravel this somewhat complex lash of multivariable letters and symbols for thet fact that someday I hope to publish my research and this class will teach me to do that. I can say one thing, and I wouldn't say that it's as apparent as it seems to me but everyone in our class is lost. So lost that when we had to turn in our first rough draft that everyone came to the next class with a handful of questions that were not easily answered. We spent a majority of that class trying so desperatly to understand what HTML was and how that corralated with Github. Quite frankly, I still don't understand how to upload my paper to Github and I've been in class asking questions for the last three weeks. Hopefully we can get this all setled with before our next paper is due, I highly doubt that though. It is one of those situations where everyone is so lost that they don't know which question to ask first or even what question will even help them understand. To that I say, "welcome to my colege life". I have a calc prof who is fresh off the boat and can barely speak english. I have to ask questions multiple times to even get him to understand the perameter of the question that I asked the first time. I suppose from here on out I just bunker down and try and make it to a few office hours before I actually start getting behind.</p>
				<p>In other news, The ultimate frisbee team is wicked. Some of those guys are just crazy good at what they do, one is even on a profesional team! I didn't even know they had pro frisbee teams. Now I know they aren't being payed a few million dollars like 90% of all pro sports now a days, probably not even enough to sutain yourself muchless a family. It would still be awesome to play on a team of people who love frisbee so much that they are on a proffessional team! the level of dedication for that is just incredable. So far I have been to one tournament where we split up teams based off drawing from a hat. That went pretty well. It rained the first day so despite the cold and wetness of everything, people were diving for everything. It was a blast. My favorite part of the whole weekend was playing cards against humanity with everyone the night after the tournament. I haven't laughed so hard since I watched Gabrial Eglacias' new standup act. Overall a great weekend to play frisbee!</p>
			<h1>blog number 2: social netwrok</h1>
				<p>The social network is quite the story, it's the depiction of how Facebook started in the small dorm room of Mark Zuckerberge and his friend Edwardow Saverage. This social media phenominon that has crushed all other social media, media that has turned MySpace into a crippled old website, is still going strong.  
			<h1>Blog Number 3: learning Codecademy</h1>
				<p>So begins Codecademy! for those of you who don't know, Codecademy is a website dedicated to teaching students the basics all the way up to the fineer points of HTML, CSS, PYHTON, and a variety of other programing mediums. I have started my first round of basics in HTML. At first I didn't like HTML. I thought it was confusing and somewhat irritating to continuely create hundreds of little "tags" and "keys" just to write a few paragraphs, but now I am begining to like it. I have taken the first step past basics and now that we're learning how to do things like change < style="font-family:Garamond"/> font styles and do things like <em>emphasize</em> words or make them <strong>bold</strong>. so it's kind of fun now. There is still a lot of work to be done though. I'm only 25% of the way through codecademy...</p>
					<p><ol>
					<li style="font-color:Blue">I still have a lot to learn about changing colors</li>
					<li style="font-family:Garamond">changing fonts</li>
					<li> and making lists </li>
					</ol></p>
				<p>for now I suppose I will just stick to the basics through github and continue until I learn enough to make/upload my own website. I do have to say that HTML is still tedious and I have to constantly remember the code for certain things. I've gotten to the point where I created a seperate page within my blog where I just have a list of the code for how to do things. until I can repeate those codes enough to have them memorized, I think this will have to do. Now I suppose I'll leave you and get back to Codecademy and continue learning.</p>
			<h1>Blog number 4: Hello Spotify...Pandora</h1>
				<p> Today I was listening to pandora and complaining to my friend that you coundn't listen to specific songs on Pandora, just whatever Pandora thought you should listen to. He looked at me said said "I have the soution", he then proceeded to show me a website called "Spotify". If you don't know what Spotify is, it is a website created for listening to music. Once signed up you can search for any song, artist, or album and listen to it directly or choose to listen to a mix inwhich that song is included. It does everything Pandora does with the ability to listen to just one song or album. I believe that I will never use Pandora again. Consider this my resignation from any use of Pandora and a Ode to the magnifisence of Spotify. There are a multitude of other uses for Spotify as well. As a spotify member (which is free), you can follow artists and thier likes or you can follow other Spotify members and listen to what mixes they are listening to. When you follow a person on Spotify their likes and other followers appear on a side bar that links you to their music choices. If Eight Tracks and Pandora had a baby...it would be Spotify. Another feature of Spotify that I admire over Pandora is that Spotify doesn't stop playing your music after a certain amount of time <strong>"YES PANDORA, I am still listening!"</strong>. I know we've all been there before...Overall I would choose Spotify over Pandora or Eight Tracks because of its duality to listen to music mixes as well as specific songs unlike either previous site. </p>
			<h1>Blog number 5:MSU for the <strong>WIN!</strong></h1>
				<p>Today MIchigan State's football team beat Michigan!!!</p>
				<p>A long time ago (senior year of highschool) I was a Michigan fan, saddening I konw. Shortly after coming to Michigan State I became a State fan for obivous reasons. My older sister however attended Michigan for college and is still a Michigan fan (no matter how many times thye lose). So the game. Michigan State killed Michigan's deffence, just straight put them to rest. While Michigan State's deffence got sack, after sack, after sack, against Michigan's offensive line! it just made them look pitiful. our deffencive team was blowing through their offensive line like they were toddlers out their on the field, a glorious sight for any State fan. Michigan did concour Michigan and was rightfully returned the long traditioned Paul Bunion statue. A glorious day overall for Michigan State.</p>
				<p>beating Michigan was not the only highlight however. The real triumph came with the all ever glorious first row seats that we had at the game. It was a cold grueling pregame night. Me and my friend got their at 12am and already we were 3rd in line. It was 16 degrees the entire night and the mounds of bundled cloths we braught were still not enough. Before the night was over we did attempt to make friends with the guys that were akready waiting in line. This attempt quickly came to a haught because they were getting agitated by the cold and inturn quite grumpy. So me and Matt (the friend I was with) just kept to ourselves the rest of the night and a long night it was. At the point where we concluded that no more people were going to come and take our spot, we tried to keep warm by running laps around the stadium. This worked, but only while we were moving. As soon as you stopped you instantaniously got cold again due to the wind. In hind sight, the wind was the worst part. If it was just cold I could have delt with that but the wind stung. We all know exactly what I'm talking about. your ears, nose, fingers, and toes all burned from th freezing wind! an awful night. Every second of it was worth sitting front row though.</p>
			<h1>Blog number 6: two poems for the sake of poems</h1>
			<h3> so you think you're not strong?</h3>			
<p>
Who says you’re not strong?
You get that from the minds of the wrong.
They say you are weak?
But it is really them who need the tweak.

So stand your ground
And don’t put on a frown,
Because in the end,
When you’ve reached the end of the band
You will be the one with the upper hand.

By-Patrick Sharp

As you set out on life’s road
unsure of the path you’ll go,
the most important thing you can do
is to always be true to “you”

Always remember who you are
in moments of struggle or fear.
Never forget or give up on
the hopes and dreams you hold dear

There will be setbacks and rejection
and moments of failure too,
but you must overcome any frustration
to achieve the potential of you.

Don’t forget to smile, or laugh,
or to live in the present;
no matter where life takes you
make every memory pleasant.

As you travel along your journey,
know that you’re never alone
and I’ll always be here for you
should you need the comfort of home.

			<h1>Blog number 7:My grandmother</h1>
				<p>My grandmother, what a curious creature she is. She grew up on a long time ago, in a place not so far away. She was born the youngest of seven, but the oldest in maturity. Although she is the last alive of her line, she is the oldest of mine. I belive that she began smoking somewhere around the age of 8 and has been a strong supporter ever since. Despite her unwavering throat issues and lung problems, she keeps buying those cigarettes. My grandmother is curious, this much I know. I got that same bloodline, for that I can show. She began in simple jobs like the factory and working on a sewing machine but gradually worked her way up. She did go to college and went on to be a nurse.Although For twenty straight years she practiced driving the hurse. She loved her knoledge books, papers, and sports. IF she lost any one, she'd go into comatose. She's read more books in her life than I could find at the library and more to her grandchildren than I can remember. I grew up loving her and this has been unwavered, fro from here I got snickers as my favorite flavor. She's adventurous, but knows her bounds, sarcastic yet to the point. She konws exactly what to do, no matter the case. She always has time to tell you a story but even more time to listen to yours. She lives now for her grandchildren and the sports that they play, but even more entreaguing to her is watching her own kids grow up and be parents. She has raised some of the most sarcastic people I have ever met in my life, but the wisest group I've ever seen. They have her playfulness in their genes but her work effort at their heart. She is amazing to me and I hope they will same of me when I am her age.</p>
			<h1>Blog number 8:Ender's Game</h1>
				<p>Have you ever read <em>Ender's Game</em>? well if you haven't than I suggest that you do. The book is phenominal overall and has a 1984 esc feel. The premis of the story is that the world is under attack by an alien species of Bee like creatures and the humans are losing. The aliens at this point have learned all of the human tactics and have found ways to counteract them. They have humanity on the run! In a last ditch effort, humanity struggles to find a new form of thought or tactics before the final strike from the alien race wipes out the entire human starfleet and makes it's way to Earth. The last effort that man kind makes is to train children, who fear nothing, think out of the physical realm, and act on impulse rather than traditional thought to lead their fleets to victory over the alien race. This is where the main character "Ender Wiggen" is introduced. Ender is the child of a normal family who takes the role of the small fry. He gets picked on, beat up, and thrown around by his brother. The only real affection that ender receives is from his older sister Valentine. The two siblings grow extremely close at the beggining of the novel. Ender is then taken and put into the space fleet at the age of somewhere in preteen years. I won't ruin the novel but Enger goes through rigorous training and becomes one of the obvious tactictions of the field. He becomes the prodogy actually...</p><p>from here on though, I leave to you to look into and read about</p>
			<h1>Blog number 9:Dorm Life</h1>
				<p>Dorms are an essential part of the psychological growing up in my opinion. They are a bridge between the command life of living under the rules of your parents to the freedom of living with hundreds of kids that are all your age under one roof. This, this mear magical place of residence is no ordinary room though, it is the pinacle transition phase of life! You learn so much about society and the rules they follow by the life of a dorm. You learn respect fro other people and their needs. You also learn about yourself. Within college and drom life you can determin if you like living side by side with hundreds of people much like in a city or if you can't wait to get away to a wide open field house. These are all important things to think about while in the dorms of a college. Myself though, I love the dorms! absolutly and unconditionally. At any given point in time I can walk down the hall and ask 10 people if they want to go play basketball or grab some food, or just hangout and play video games. It's perfect! ALong with that, nearly everybody on my hall shares the same interests. What do you expect of 46 guys who are all 18-20 and in the engineering building? With the guys on my floor I can go to any party with and not have to worry about them, I can got o the movies with them on thursdays when the UAB shows the free flicks. At nearly every time of the day someone is always looking to do something. I have grown so close to these guys that I started scheduling classes with them, living arangements for next year, and even got invited to a wedding by one of them. Now if that's not close than I don't know what is. I believe that dorm life is anessential part of growing up and everyone should get the chance to experience it.</p>
			<h1>Blog number 10:Comemoration</h1>
				<p> Last night I was sitting down with a few of my highschool friends and I began to realize something kind of noteworthy. Through out the course of high school I did a lot of crazy things and have a lot of memories but the realization came when they started pulling things up that I had forgotten about. I had blocked out a vast majority of everything about highschool, girls I had dated and weird incendences with them, people I had been friends with that normally I wouldn't have been, all kinds of crazy things. The more and more they dug up, the more and more I realized I had blocked out. They made me realize that highschool in essence was useless to me. I loved the sports and the things I learned and a few of the friends I  had, but for the most part high school is just a big blur that I could have skiped over and been all the wiser. My highschool was kind of small, about 1,800 kids and that meant that everyone knew everyone. I knew every person that walked across the stage at graduation and their life story. I hated that. I don't want to know everyone and their tale since they were in pre-K. My mother told me one day after someone had asked me if I was ready to go to college that she thought I had been ready to leave since I was a sophomore! She was right too. I wouldn't have missed a thing, changed for the better or worse, nor learned anything (barring my Math and Physics classes of course) important. All of the classes in high school are useless. Tell me when I'm ever going to need to know half the stuff I learned in any of the history classes, and the useless writing we did in english? It was all just a little rubish. Now you may think "Blah, blah, we've heard it all before...", but everyone's got to have one of those moments in their life where they realize that they've wasted a good part of four years.</p>
				<p>So here I stand in college, looking back on my wasted four years and think,"well what about the good?". I did learn a lot about swimming and the finner points of body motion from my swim team as well as self disapline and hard work. I also learned from my swim team what it really meant to lead by example and it's impact. I also learned how to be a leader from and take charge when the time comes from Boy Scouts. I also learned the ever important of how to step dowmn from that leadership position when you are not needed, which many still need to learn. I learned about dedication in drum line and so much more from my extra curiculars but that's exactly where I learned them, from extra curiculars. I didnt' learn how to work in teams by the dumb group projects in high school classes or by working on power points with other students. I learned it all from the sports I played and the groups I was in outside of school.
			<h1>Blog number 11:Xbox Live and Ben...</h1>
				<p>There once was a man who's name was Ben. Ben was a quiet and subtle man with pale skin and red hair. He has always been a little on the shy side. Ben's downfall or should I say kryptonite is Xbox Live. When Ben turns on that Xbox...He becomes a different man. If you were in the room with him, you would think that you were watching an episode of a game show in vegas. As soon as Ben puts that mic on his ear he goes bananas! He rambles on about absolutley nothing to anyone who has a mic, he pretends to be a Youtube channel host, He begins screaming vulgar like you never thought possible, he even pretends to be of ethnic desents that he clearly is not. It is like that mic turns the switch in his brain that releases his voice box from a strangled noose and opens the floodgates of his imagination. In hinds sight he probably should make a Youtube channel abput him playing because it is so rediculously funny.</p>
				<p>The other day Ben's girlfriend came and visited him here at MSU and got a chance to experience this "other side" of Ben that she rarely sees. Her expersion throughout the duration of the time Ben played was somewhere within the bounds of her face in her hands, huffing, and a large amount of shaking her head. She was less than plaesed to say the least, embaraced would be a better way to put it actually. I, on the contrary, love this side of Ben and encourage him to continue play Xbox any chance we have free time. I encourage it so much that I'll get on Xbox Live over Christmas break just to play with him. I can't wait!</p>
			<h1>Blog number 12:Ryan Guard as the inturperter</h1>
				<p>Ryan is my suitmate. He's a scruffly lookin' kind of guy who came from Florida. This boy is a hard core punk rock, head-bangin', Blink-182 fan. This guy listens to Blink-182 all day, everyday! I like to hangout with ryan because he is a master remix artist and by that I mean he changes the lyrics to every song. The only problem is that he changes the words to inappropriate words and phrases. This is funny a majority of the time when we're alone or with some friends but it gets really annoying when we're out in public and he's screaming vulgar at the top of his lungs. It also gets really annoying when you're trying to study or do homework and he's just singing away!</p>
				<p>The other part that really grinds my gears is that he only has one class and sits in his bed all day long! He always says stuff like "oh I want to go out and do something, or when can we shoot hoops", but then when we actually go out and do something he sits on his butt and does nothing. He's from Florida though, and everything he says is "wow, I never knew it was going to be so cold in Michigan". To each his own I suppose though. I personally think it's way to hot in Florida to live there.</p>
			<h1>Blog number 13: Merry Christmas:Dorm style!</h1>
				<p>Today me and the guys on the fourth floor of west wilson baught sixty candy canes and wrote a nice litle message on them. The notes were,"Happy Holidays and good luck on finals! from 4-west boys." we tapped the note to a cane and hung them on all the girl's doors. No more than five minutes later there were twenty tweets about how awesome it was and how much they loved it, best ides ever. The nest day we also recieved thank you notes from a few of the girls. It was a nice night.</p>
				<p> also in the spirit of christmas my floor did a secret santa. We put everyone's name in a jar and drew tags. I ended up with Ryan Guard's name. In light of his vulgar and crude comments I attempted to find him a sexually explicit gift for secret santa but was shot down when I couldn't find a company that would send the package...descreatly. so instead I found him an alarm clock that rolls around the room and doesn't turn off until you catch it, for his notorious sleeping problem. He loved it when he opend it. The list of gifts goes in this order: Matt got a soda bandaleer, Ryan the alarm clock, Ben got a lego, and Charlie got Scott Pilgram vs. The World. quite the secret santa extravagansa we had. The price limit was somewhere around $15-20 so that kind of limited it a little bit but everything ended up great in the end. Christmas is my favorite time of year, not just because of the gifts but because of the bonds we all share and grow in.</p>
			<h1>Blog number 14:Dare I say it....Macheal</h1>
				<p>Micheal is Charlie's girlfriend and they've been dating for some time (6 months) and they're going through a rough patch, to say the least. The problem is that it's her fault and I just see Charlie criplling under the let down and pain of his faultering relationship. Some might argue "you're only in college ad it barely even matters yet" but for him it's something a little more special than that. She on the other hand, I don't believe that she understands the anguish he feels. I also don't think she sees this relationship the same way Charlie does. The problem from my stance is that Charlie is one of those guys who refuses to share his emotions with you. I have to dig and pry fro hours just to get a few meaningful words out of him. This would be fine because that's just the way he is but it makes me feel bad beacuse I want to help but he just shuts down. I don't think that he doesn't want to talk about it I just think he's a little uneasy about the whole thing together. Oh well, We'll see where it goes from here</p>
			<h1>BLog number 15:As it Winds Down</h1>			
	<p>Hello worls and wlecome to my last blog post! I've studied all that I could, read all the papers I need, and done all of the reviews to prepare for my finals. All I can do now is read over my note cards and pray that I do well. Tomorrow we'll see just how much I actually learned this semester. Man it has been a long semester of confusing HTML filled nights and papers but it is coming to an end. So here I sign off probably for the last time as I listen to christmas music on spotify, have a wonderful Christmas break and spend some time with your family and friends like I am going to do! goodnight world andf good luck to all the college students on finals this week!</p>
