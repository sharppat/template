			<h1>blog number 1: welcome to confusion...</h1>
			<p>So, this is my blog for my writing class. Thus far if I've learned anything at all it would be that HTML is quite confusing and even when it is all set up for me to use and layed out to the fact that all I have to do is type in the blank space...I still feel lost. that being said, I am excited to learn HTML and unravel this somewhat complex lash of multivariable letters and symbols for thet fact that someday I hope to publish my research and this class will teach me to do that. I can say one thing, and I wouldn't say that it's as apparent as it seems to me but everyone in our class is lost. So lost that when we had to turn in our first rough draft that everyone came to the next class with a handful of questions that were not easily answered. We spent a majority of that class trying so desperatly to understand what HTML was and how that corralated with Github. Quite frankly, I still don't understand how to upload my paper to Github and I've been in class asking questions for the last three weeks. Hopefully we can get this all setled with before our next paper is due, I highly doubt that though. It is one of those situations where everyone is so lost that they don't know which question to ask first or even what question will even help them understand. To that I say, "welcome to my colege life". I have a calc prof who is fresh off the boat and can barely speak english. I have to ask questions multiple times to even get him to understand the perameter of the question that I asked the first time. I suppose from here on out I just bunker down and try and make it to a few office hours before I actually start getting behind.</p>
			<p>In other news, The ultimate frisbee team is wicked. Some of those guys are just crazy good at what they do, one is even on a profesional team! I didn't even know they had pro frisbee teams. Now I know they aren't being payed a few million dollars like 90% of all pro sports now a days, probably not even enough to sutain yourself muchless a family. It would still be awesome to play on a team of people who love frisbee so much that they are on a proffessional team! the level of dedication for that is just incredable. So far I have been to one tournament where we split up teams based off drawing from a hat. That went pretty well. It rained the first day so despite the cold and wetness of everything, people were diving for everything. It was a blast. My favorite part of the whole weekend was playing cards against humanity with everyone the night after the tournament. I haven't laughed so hard since I watched Gabrial Eglacias' new standup act. Overall a great weekend to play frisbee!</p>
			<h1>blog number 2: social netwrok</h1>
			<p>The social network is quite the story, it's the depiction of how Facebook started in the small dorm room of Mark Zuckerberge and his friend Edwardow Saverage. This social media phenominon that has crushed all other social media, media that has turned MySpace into a crippled old website, is still going strong.
