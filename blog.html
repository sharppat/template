			<h1>blog number 1: welcome to confusion...</h1>
				<p>So, this is my blog for my writing class. Thus far if I've learned anything at all it would be that HTML is quite confusing and even when it is all set up for me to use and layed out to the fact that all I have to do is type in the blank space...I still feel lost. that being said, I am excited to learn HTML and unravel this somewhat complex lash of multivariable letters and symbols for thet fact that someday I hope to publish my research and this class will teach me to do that. I can say one thing, and I wouldn't say that it's as apparent as it seems to me but everyone in our class is lost. So lost that when we had to turn in our first rough draft that everyone came to the next class with a handful of questions that were not easily answered. We spent a majority of that class trying so desperatly to understand what HTML was and how that corralated with Github. Quite frankly, I still don't understand how to upload my paper to Github and I've been in class asking questions for the last three weeks. Hopefully we can get this all setled with before our next paper is due, I highly doubt that though. It is one of those situations where everyone is so lost that they don't know which question to ask first or even what question will even help them understand. To that I say, "welcome to my colege life". I have a calc prof who is fresh off the boat and can barely speak english. I have to ask questions multiple times to even get him to understand the perameter of the question that I asked the first time. I suppose from here on out I just bunker down and try and make it to a few office hours before I actually start getting behind.</p>
				<p>In other news, The ultimate frisbee team is wicked. Some of those guys are just crazy good at what they do, one is even on a profesional team! I didn't even know they had pro frisbee teams. Now I know they aren't being payed a few million dollars like 90% of all pro sports now a days, probably not even enough to sutain yourself muchless a family. It would still be awesome to play on a team of people who love frisbee so much that they are on a proffessional team! the level of dedication for that is just incredable. So far I have been to one tournament where we split up teams based off drawing from a hat. That went pretty well. It rained the first day so despite the cold and wetness of everything, people were diving for everything. It was a blast. My favorite part of the whole weekend was playing cards against humanity with everyone the night after the tournament. I haven't laughed so hard since I watched Gabrial Eglacias' new standup act. Overall a great weekend to play frisbee!</p>
			<h1>blog number 2: social netwrok</h1>
				<p>The social network is quite the story, it's the depiction of how Facebook started in the small dorm room of Mark Zuckerberge and his friend Edwardow Saverage. This social media phenominon that has crushed all other social media, media that has turned MySpace into a crippled old website, is still going strong.  
			<h1>Blog Number 3: learning Codecademy</h1>
				<p>So begins Codecademy! for those of you who don't know, Codecademy is a website dedicated to teaching students the basics all the way up to the fineer points of HTML, CSS, PYHTON, and a variety of other programing mediums. I have started my first round of basics in HTML. At first I didn't like HTML. I thought it was confusing and somewhat irritating to continuely create hundreds of little "tags" and "keys" just to write a few paragraphs, but now I am begining to like it. I have taken the first step past basics and now that we're learning how to do things like change < style="font-family:Garamond"/> font styles and do things like <em>emphasize</em> words or make them <strong>bold</strong>. so it's kind of fun now. There is still a lot of work to be done though. I'm only 25% of the way through codecademy...</p>
					<p><ol>
					<li style="font-color:Blue">I still have a lot to learn about changing colors</li>
					<li style="font-family:Garamond">changing fonts</li>
					<li> and making lists </li>
					</ol></p>
				<p>for now I suppose I will just stick to the basics through github and continue until I learn enough to make/upload my own website. I do have to say that HTML is still tedious and I have to constantly remember the code for certain things. I've gotten to the point where I created a seperate page within my blog where I just have a list of the code for how to do things. until I can repeate those codes enough to have them memorized, I think this will have to do. Now I suppose I'll leave you and get back to Codecademy and continue learning.</p>
			<h1>Blog number 4: Hello Spotify...Pandora</h1>
				<p> Today I was listening to pandora and complaining to my friend that you coundn't listen to specific songs on Pandora, just whatever Pandora thought you should listen to. He looked at me said said "I have the soution", he then proceeded to show me a website called "Spotify". If you don't know what Spotify is, it is a website created for listening to music. Once signed up you can search for any song, artist, or album and listen to it directly or choose to listen to a mix inwhich that song is included. It does everything Pandora does with the ability to listen to just one song or album. I believe that I will never use Pandora again. Consider this my resignation from any use of Pandora and a Ode to the magnifisence of Spotify. There are a multitude of other uses for Spotify as well. As a spotify member (which is free), you can follow artists and thier likes or you can follow other Spotify members and listen to what mixes they are listening to. When you follow a person on Spotify their likes and other followers appear on a side bar that links you to their music choices. If Eight Tracks and Pandora had a baby...it would be Spotify. Another feature of Spotify that I admire over Pandora is that Spotify doesn't stop playing your music after a certain amount of time <strong>"YES PANDORA, I am still listening!"</strong>. I know we've all been there before...Overall I would choose Spotify over Pandora or Eight Tracks because of its duality to listen to music mixes as well as specific songs unlike either previous site. </p>
