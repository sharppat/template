			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Unbeknownst to the world, pornography affects everyone, whether you’ve watched it or not. It cares not whether you are man, woman, or adolescent. You will read how despite the attempts of multiple government agencies to regulate its use, there are no restrictions on its bounds. It finds its way into our homes, our culture, our media, and even our adolescent population. Discussed within is the plethora of research pointing at the detrimental effects of the pornographic industry upon our way of life. It cripples us, it feeds off our desire to be like the fake fantasies we watch, and twists our views of the importance behind sexual relations between the sexes. Although there is an endless list of negative effects that come from the pornography industry and its move into social acceptance, this paper will only go into detail the few issues that stand extrema among the others.</p>

Pornography OBJECTIFIES and DISGRACES women.</p><p>4.	PORNOGRAPHY creates two dimensional LIES about reality. </p><p>1.	Psychological problems in teen boys

With America as its battle field, the Pornography industry is winning the war against teen men by means of psychological warfare. With the internet on a rampage and the ever easier access to pornographic cites, it has become almost effortless for children and teen boys to indulge in fake sexual fantasy. Do to this outburst, over the last thirty years, the socially accepted age for sexual activities has taken a skydive into adolescence. At increasingly younger ages teens are discovering pornographic websites and becoming sexually curious. The effects of this pubescent curiosity have been drastic thus far and only continues to spiral out of control. Gail Dine, a distinguished member of the Psychology field, notes that during high school years, teen men who become addicted to pornography “neglect their schoolwork, spend huge amounts of money they don’t have, become isolated from others, and often suffer depression.” (Pornland, 93). These undignified habits seep into the minds of teen boys and tend more often than not to stick with them throughout the course of their adult years. As the age of curiosity decreases and sexual activity becomes more socially accepted, George Orwell’s A Brave New World and 1984 become ever more realistic. 
</p><p>2.	Porn becomes self-serving
Pornography cripples the intimacy between lovers and makes the act of sexual intercourse bounds for self service or also commonly referred to as masturbation. Masturbation takes a large toll on the physical intimacy of sexual intercourse as well as diminishes the brain stimulation when involved in sexual acts. Over a period of time “to much lovin’” from self-service can create an abnormal amount of sex hormones and neurotransmitters. This overproduction of hormones can lead to a multitude of psychosomatic problems including hair loss, depression, fatigue, pelvis and testicular pain, fantasy esc envisionment, and introverted behavior. (Negative Side Effects of Masturbation, 2). Masturbation also creates an overabundant pile of guilt upon the person in act. Do to social disapproval of masturbation, the operator becomes a “closet masturbator” and builds up an abundance of guilt and self-disapproval. This can ultimately lead to cases of introverted personality, self-esteem issues, and even long term depression.
</p><p>3.	Porn Disgraces Women
Much like the self-objective effects of pornography on men, women are just as susceptible to its influence, and it has an endless list of other tricks in store for them. Emphasis returns to the fact that the pornographic industry has affected you whether you’ve watched it or not. The expanded bounds of pornography and the massive consumption of its products have ruptured into society and hypersexualized the entire culture. With the birth of the twenty-first century and a new technological age, we are being born into a porn ridden world and exposed to a pornified culture where women are pulling up the short straw. Gail continues to explain that,” By inundating girls and women with the message that their most worthy attribute is their sexual hotness and crowding out other messages, pop culture is grooming them just like an individual perpetrator would. It is slowly chipping away at their self-esteem, stripping them of a sense of themselves as whole human beings, and providing them with an identity that emphasizes sex and de-emphasizes every other human attribute (Pornland, 118). Pornography is ripping away layers of self-esteem from women and trying to provoke their sexual nature as if it’s a public display. Women are being degraded to sexual items instead of perfectly capable human beings. These degrading effects have started to trickle down into teen life as well as dabbling into adolescence. Shows like Baby Beauty and Baby Idol are staggering proofs that society seeks to beautify its women and reinforce that sexual attraction is everything. Women are being battered left and right with the reminder that if you’re not beautiful, you’re nothing. Gail later explains that in 87% of television ads, women are depicted displaying items in a sensual or provocative way on channels ranging from American Movie Classics to ABC Family. Repeated exposure of society to this provocative imagery only continues to thin out the line between explicit and socially acceptable materials. 
</p><p>4.	Porn lies
Pornography is a fictional piece of work that creates a fantasy world where women drop limp for men and indulge them with erotic pleasure. In a vast majority of cases the men seem to have absolute control over them and portray an almost ruler like complex. On the other hand, women play the role of grovel, practically and sometimes literally begging for men to engage in sexual acts with them.  These are two standard characteristics portrayed in pornographic films. They depict men and women as having two dimensional personalities and always a “one track mind”. Constant exposure to this kind of behavior begins to change the mindset of the onlooker. It molds their minds and makes them actually act according to the scenes depicted in the films, believing that women should fall over for a man who want to have sexual relations with them. In many cases this is not a problem as long as the opposing party portrays that they do not have the same beliefs or desires. The issue arises when the perpetrator also believes another lie portrayed in pornographic films, “no means yes”. This leads to many other problems and illegal activity under sexual assault and even rape. Since the public release of pornographic films in the early 1970’s, illegal activities such as underage sex, public indecency, and harsher crimes such as rape and assault have increased from 171,510 to 845,115 reported cases in the United States alone. (United States Crime Rates). These two dimensional personalities are beginning to tear apart society as a whole and force them into an era where sexual relations are common practice and acceptable among anyone and everyone. Once again we return to the horrible truth that George Orwell warned us about.
