			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>the backbone of progress. It is the sole reason of our advance in the technological age and is the blueprint of every creation. Engineering defined by Webster’s dictionary is, “The application of science and mathematics by which the properties of matter and the sources of energy in nature are made useful to people”. With that in mind we can conclude that everything we do, everything we use, any tool, object, or machine, we use is a piece of engineering. Within this paper you will read how engineering has been around since before the word its self was defined and how everything within the manmade world correlates to the field of engineering.</p>
	<p>Each part of the field of study is important in its own way and is specific to the piece of technology at hand. Throughout this paper you will find numerous examples of the application of technology in both history and modern day scenarios that have led to the production of a better product and how that was possible or accelerated with the spread of information.</p> <p>Coupled with a brief history of engineering you will also find how the importance of communication has been the success as well as the demise of some engineering feats. Communication is one of the keys in every project and it will be detailed about how the different forms of communication have affected the field of engineering. with real life accounts from professor Timothy J. Hinds, PhD in Mechanical Engineering who is currently researching and teaching at Michigan State University, as well as from corporate advisor Mathew Silvis,                    Masters from Colorado University. The accounts of both men will give foundation and support to the importance of all three topics and their take on each topics importance.</p>	</article>
