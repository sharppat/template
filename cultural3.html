			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p> South Park is a show that is viewed by millions each year for its comedic look on the social issues of the world. For years South Park has been making light of situations like ethnic discrimination and pornographic films. For a majority of the population it is a way to get around dealing with the social awkwardness of the actual problem with the use of a few laughs, but for some it can be a different story. Pornography is a problem. It’s a personal problem for an increasing amount of Americans and a cultural problem for the world. With the explosion of new technology around every corner, it has become easier for businesses to get away with more and more. This paper will detail the evident changes in society that stem exclusively from the desensitizing of the pornography industry and its effects on society. You may believe that you have been unaffected by the pornography industry, but you have. Embedded in everyday life is the essence of the industry its self. You will read and learn how the easy accessibility, the influence over media and technology, and the encouragement in the eyes of the teenage population all contribute to the overwhelming impact of the pornography industry upon our culture.</p>
