			<h1>How SHOULD You Write</h1>
			<p>Since writing covers the largest range of mediums within communication, it is important to know how to effectively communicate through this medium as an engineer. As an engineer, there are a multitude of different styles used in reporting scientific findings or new inventions. Ranging from auto biographies to patent files, engineers follow a sort of unwritten law of organization. Without this respect to professionalism, most publications are thrown aside. Many engineers will use formats such as MLA but a more common structure is the step-by-step write-up of the experiment or hypothesis style paper. Whatever form of structure they choose, organization is key. Many thesis papers begin with stating the strong key points in which they will be elaborating on and then further explaining them throughout the paper. This writing format is normally very rigid and formal. An online paper is much more informal. The paper normally begins with a topic statement and a strong alluring phrase followed by a write-up that supports the claim. This paper is normally filled with charts or pictures to draw visual contraception to the paper. Referenced earlier, no matter the type of paper or style you use, there are keys points that make any paper important in the field of engineering. Specific phrases and words that pertain to the subject always key in the reader that you know what you’re talking about. Similarly, nice structure between paragraphs is another sure sign of at least slight congnisental awareness. These points help give confidence to the reader that your paper is worth the time to read.</p>
