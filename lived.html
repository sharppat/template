		<h1>From LEGO Blocks to Circuit Blocks</h1>
		<p>Being raised in childhood fuzz
Happy as my childhood was,
Was the beginning of something soon to be
A dream job and career that was made for me.
</p>
<p>This one colorful toy
Crafted specially for one smiling boy
Was the first stage in a lifelong path,
Now If only they could get me to take a bath</p>
<p>This geometric shape
Was smarter than your average ape.
it could be a fire truck or a dancing tree
it could be anything it wanted to be.</p>
<p>It helped me learn just what it meant
To structure an idea and how to prevent
Collapsing colorful structures of yellow and blue
Or making starwars jets that actually flew</p>
<p>This toy has taught me so much it seems
That from every crack of my childhood it seems to gleam
And lay the foundations for the next years in my life
So I would never have to strife</p>
<p>This toy is the lego and it seams to me
That it still shines and makes me free!
To build my imagination
And help me with my own creation.</p>
<p>This poem is not just a jumble of cleverly rhymed words, it’s a story, a story that tells of my childhood and what it is soon to be. It tells of how my future has been shaped by my past and most of all it tells about a boy who fell in love with Legos and how that changed his future forever. Legos were everything that was my childhood toys. They were the reigning champ of every Christmas list, the most veteran friend at the dinner table, and the baseboards that sculpted my creative mind. The infinite mountains of multicolored bricks lined every nook and cranny of my floor and measly brick replicas of any and every vehicle occupied all of my shelves. Lego Land was the main attraction of every Florida trip, boxes of new bricks lay tucked away in every Christmas and birthday present, and the bright red and white “LEGO” symbols lined my wallpaper. From ages five to twelve, it consumed me, defined me, and helped me get to where I am now. </p>
<p>As a child with a burning desire for engineering, my favorite toy was undeniably the Lego. Legos were the first step on my path towards a long carrier in engineering. They were a prime opportunity to take the ideas and creations out of my head and display them into a working, mechanical being. I still remember when I was five years old and barely able to add my stubby little fingers together, my brothers showed me how to build my first Lego, a tiny land rover from a collection of space crusaders. It was a marveled master piece in my hands. I felt like I had found that piece of my adolescence that I had been missing all along. It was something that Batman action figures and cartoons could never replace. It was a spectacled treasure in which no amount of candy coated bowls of ice cream with sprinkles could ever overcome. That tiny little rover, no more than 20 pieces collective, had lit a spark under a funnel fire that was about to erupt into bustling flames.</p>
<p>With the discovery of Legos in the world of five year old Patrick it was as if all of the sudden, anything my mind could dream or imagine was able to be built with the right combination of colors and geometric shapes. Fundamental mechanics didn’t’ apply, only the imagination and the limit of patience were the bounds of creation. Blueprints were an unnecessary part of the process at the time, all the ideas skipped the planning stages and went directly into prototyping and production. My room quickly became a small factory for thousands of tiny sculptures and robots alike. I could spend hours in my room building mindless imagination after the next, and so I spent a good majority of ages five to eleven doing exactly that. The living room, fit for a family of eight, readily became an open field for me to scatter the mess of bricks out into an organized map, Christmas afternoon was filled with instruction manuals from new Star Wars Legos, and the dinner table was always set for one extra 4bit friend. </p>
<p>These miniature sculpting tools had opened my cognizance to the creativity through mechanics and would eventually overflow that same interest into computer hardware and other toy tinkering. The mechanical thought process of lego building led me so far as to take apart my family’s first computer and reconstruct it into a server before my dad could get home from work. This same drive also followed through from legos and into a fascination with physics and other technical classes like Computer Aided Design and Drafting. While in school I greatly acceled at physics and developed a love for the physical laws of the universe as well as the yearning to investigate the parts of physics that remain unanswered. One main attribute that I contribute to my long favored childhood toy is the limitlessness of possibility. In the unbounded ideology of the lego universe, any idea could be expanded, contracted, remodeled, completely reengineered, taken apart and rebuild with no cost, with the only rule of letting your imagination get the best of you. If any engineer took this same mindset into a project, his output would be far greater and far more successful than any of his peers. I can only conceive that this trait long learned from tinkering with toys will carry on with me through my career and give me a noticeable advantage in prototyping and the design aspect of my projects. </p>
<p>All of these attributes and skills that I have now can be traced way back, through a twisted tree of pyramid graphs and back to the first brick that touched my hand. That one little rover that changed my childhood and shaped my future has lead me to this point. Now I am an engineer, studying at Michigan State University, working for a future in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. These childhood toys have given me the mechanical mindset, a desire to create with innovative function, and a passion for building outside the box. They set some of the fundamental ideas of building blocks and structural support and laid the foundation for technology soon to come.</p>
