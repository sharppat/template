		<h1>Title here</h1>
		<p>Adolescence, arguably the most influential time of our existence. “During the first three years, your child's brain triples in weight and establishes about 1,000 trillion nerve connections.” – Babycenter blog. It is at this time when our ever developing brains soak up every ounce of superior influence we encounter. A large majority of this influence comes from watching our parents or the people around us perform simple tasks or say simple words like mamma and dada. It is this evolution in the human order in which we learn to say our first words, learn to eat food, and even take our first wobbly steps towards a world that is already running around us. Even though the majority of us are not able to change our own dippers yet, we’ve already begun subconscious preparation for the vast future ahead of us through the toys we play with. For all the future Bill Gates, Hennery Fords, and little Einsteins, there is a noticeable trend for the desire to play with the rainbow of geometric shapes known to society as LEGOs.</p>
<p>As a child with a burning desire for engineering, my favorite toy was undeniably the Lego. The infinite mountains of multicolored bricks lined every nook and cranny of my floor and measly brick replicas of any and every vehicle occupied every one of my shelves. Lego Land was the main attraction of every Florida trip, boxes of new bricks lay tucked away in every Christmas and birthday present, and the bright red and white “LEGO” symbols lined my wallpaper. Legos were the first step on my path towards a long carrier in engineering. Legos were a prime opportunity to take the ideas and creations out of my head and display them into a working mechanism. All of the sudden, anything my mind could dream or imagine was able to be built with the right combination of colors and geometric shapes. Blueprints were an unnecessary part of the process at the time, all the ideas skipped the planning stages and went directly into prototyping and production. My room quickly became a small factory for thousands of tiny sculptures and robots alike. I could spend hours in my room building mindless imagination after the other, and so I spent a good majority of ages five to eleven doing exactly that. The living room, fit for a family of eight, readily became an open field for me to scatter the mess of bricks out into an organized map, Christmas afternoon was filled with instruction manuals from new Star Wars Legos, and the dinner table was always set for one extra 4bit friend. </p>
