			<h1>What Dr. Hinds Has to Say About It</h1>
			<p>Now that you have a relative idea of communication and the spread of information, take account of two individuals who have worked and taught in the field of engineering. Collectively they have 60 years of experience and have worked in nearly every region of the world, perusing new forms of engineering. Professor Timothy J. Hinds is a professor for engineering at Michigan State University and formerly a supplier for General Motors and Good Year Tires. Professor Hinds explains in an interview that without thorough communication on any type of project, it instantly starts to fall apart, “Each part of a project is specific and important to the individual working on it and if they cannot effectively communicate or document their work to the rest of the team, than the project is in jeopardy”. Professor Hinds then recalled a multitude of events during his time with GM that fell through or cost the company large amounts of money because of a miscommunication between companies and a few wrong words in an experimental project write-up. </p>		</article>
