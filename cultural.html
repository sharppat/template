			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>With the explosion of new technology around every corner, the twenty-first century has become a proving ground for the media to test its limits. The Comedy Central favorite South Park, spends a majority of its air time doing exactly that. For seventeen straight seasons and more than 1,700 episodes (SouthParkStudios), South Park has been exploiting the socially awkward topics of society and making light of them. One specific episode during season twelve deals with the addiction to pornographic films. Over the course of the last few decades an increasing amount of television shows, such as South Park, businesses, and marketers, have been making light of pornographic films. In essence, Pornography is becoming desensitize to society and is on its way to social acceptance.</p>
