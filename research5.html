			<h1>Revolutionizing Communication For A Second Time</h1>
			<p>Another form of communication among the field is the World Wide Web or commonly referred to by the Internet. Much like books, with the invention of the internet, the spread of information skyrocketed into a new age of learning. Engineers could now publish and access other works at the touch of a few buttons. Since its invention and public release in 1991, it has been providing quick and easy access to information around the world. Along with the access to information came the spread of information communication. The internet showcased a medium for communication tools like live video chats, and forum groups, where engineers could easily publish their ideas in order to get feedback from others. This presented a whole new range of communication across the field. Professor Hinds states, “A large majority of our inventions and greatest ideas come from small chat groups or collective forums of people who never would have found each other without the use of the internet”. This new medium for communication and the spread of ideas rocked the foundation of engineering and helped open the minds of the curious to what engineering really was.</p><p>With the internet in full swing, communication became simple and the business of information exchange would be changed forever. New forms of conversation such as E-mail, instant messaging, Facebook groups, etc, allow engineers across the world easy and prompt to communication. This new medium has taken over the field so much that Dr. Mathew Silvis acknowledges, “If the internet up and disappeared tomorrow, the engineering world would fail. They rely so heavily on inter-web connection that it is now a necessity part of production”. He later also agrees that without it, his company would never have made it to where it stands now. The internet is now a prevalent medium of communication within the engineering field and is prevalent for anyone looking to be a part of it.</p>	</article>
