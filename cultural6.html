			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>In recent studies carried out in the UK by “The Big Four”, they began to enforce regulations over pornographic sites and enforcing severe age restrictions. The research showed that over the course of only a few years, as the viewing of pornography decreased, the number of sexual crimes decreased as well. (Don’t Just Regulate the Net-Regulate You’re Kids, 1). Long term effects have yet to be determined since the study has only been in effect for a few years but prospects look promising.</p>
<p> Many psychologist believe that the only real way to revert society back to normal levels is through the youth of the nation. In this view, society now is already affected by the massive onslaught of sexual views and twisted demeanor but the adolescent population can turn that around if they themselves are kept from the current views. Now this is not to say that we should all keep our children trapped in a white bubble and spoon feed them or send them all to boarding schools until they’re 18, but subtle changes should be made to try and keep pornified societal views away from them. Nothing is guaranteed and the horizon is still yet a ways off but with simple measures we may still be able to avoid a world ruled by the Ministry of Truth and a society that accepts sexual activities as everyday rituals. </p>		</article>
